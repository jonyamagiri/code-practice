## Hour1 - Taking the First Step

### Summary
> In this first lesson you learned the following basic things about the C language:
* C is a general-purpose programming language.
* C is a high-level language that has the advantages of readability, maintainability,
and portability.
* C is a very efficient language that allows you to control computer hardware and
peripherals.
* C is a small language that you can easily learn in a relatively short time.
* Programs written in C can be reused.
* Programs written in C must be compiled and translated into machine-readable code
before the computer can execute them.
* Many other programming languages, such as Perl, C++, and Java, have adopted
basic concepts and useful features from the C language. Once you learn C, learning
these other languages is much easier.
* The ANSI standard for C is the standard supported by C compiler vendors to main-
tain the portability of C programs.
* You can use any ANSI C compliant compiler to compile all of the C programs in
this book.
