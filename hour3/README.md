## Hour3 - Learning the Structure of a C Program

> In this lesson youâ€™ll learn more essentials within a C program, such as:

* Constants and variables
* Expressions
* Statements
* Statement blocks
* C function types and names
* Arguments to functions
* The body of a function
* Function calls


### Summary
> In this lesson you learned the following important concepts and operators:

* A constant in C is a value that never changes. A variable, on the other hand, can present different values.
* A combination of constants, variables, and operators is called an expression in the C language. An expression is used to denote different computations.
* The arithmetic operators include + , - , * , / , and % .
* A statement consists of a complete expression suffixed with a semicolon.
* The C compiler treats a statement block as a single statement, although the statement block might contain more than one statement.
* The function type specified in the declaration of a function determines the type of the value returned by the function.
* You have to follow certain rules to make a valid function name.
* An argument contains information that you want to pass to a function. An argument list contains two or more arguments that are separated by commas.
* The opening brace ( { ) and closing brace ( } ) are used to mark the start and end of a C function.
* A function body contains variable declarations and statements.
* Usually, a function should accomplish just one task.
