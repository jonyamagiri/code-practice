## Hour2 - Writing Your First C Program

> In this lesson youâ€™ll write your first C program and learn the basics of a C program, such as: 

* The #include directive
* Header files
* Comments
* The main() function
* The return statement
* The exit() function


### Summary
> In this lesson you learned the following concepts and statements about the C language:
* Some header files should be included at the beginning of your C program.
* Header files, such as stdio.h and stdlib.h , contain the declarations for functions used in your C program; for example, the printf() and exit() functions.
* Comments in your C programs are needed to help you in documenting your programs. You can put comments anywhere you like in your programs.
* In ANSI C, a comment starts with the opening comment mark, /* , and ends with the closing comment mark, */ .
* Every C program must have one but only one main() function. The program execution starts and ends with the main() function.
* The return statement can be used to return a value to indicate to the operating system whether an error has occurred. The exit() function terminates a program; the argument to the function indicates the error status, too.
* Compiling and linking are consecutive steps that have to be finished before an executable file is produced.
* Everybody, including you and me, makes mistakes in programming. Debugging is a very important step in your program design and coding.
